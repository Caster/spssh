# Short Plane Supports for Spatial Hypergraphs (SPSSH)

This repository contains the source code of the experiments described in Short Plane Supports for Spatial Hypergraphs. Please refer to the [source README](https://github.com/Caster/spssh/tree/master/src) for details on how to run the code. The data generated by this code, underlying the experimental results presented in the paper, can also be found in this repository.


## Dependencies

To build and run this project, you will need to include the JAR files in [`lib/`](https://github.com/Caster/spssh/tree/master/lib) in your classpath.

  - We use [GeometryCore](https://gitaga.win.tue.nl/commons/geometrycore) amongst others for its graph data structures, to find (E)MSTs, and for rendering and outputting supports. This is the main dependency of the project.
  - The [JTS Topology Suite](https://github.com/locationtech/jts) is used in the Kelp rendering code. Excluding Kelp rendering capabilities would make it possible to drop this dependency.
  - We use [SnakeYAML](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml) to read and write YAML files for batch processing. Excluding batch processing capabilities would make it possible to drop this dependency.

Aside from the JAR files bundled in this repository, we also depend on [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) and its Java bindings. CPLEX is available for free for academic purposes.

It is currently not possible to easily disable functionality and remove the need for the last three dependencies, even if they are used in small parts of the code base only. This means that all dependencies need to be met before the code can be compiled and run.
